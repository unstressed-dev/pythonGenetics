# Python Based Genetics Program

## Overview

This Python Based Program Explores the Central Dogma of Biology, featuring:

* Complements
* Transcription
* Translation (Under Development)
* Reverse Transcription

## Features

### Complements

This feature finds the complement of given DNA/RNA strand.

### Transcription

This feature transcribes the inputted DNA strand into an mRNA strand.

### Translation

This feature translates the mRNA strand into an Amino Acid Sequence, with would be outputted from the N terminus to the C terminus.

### Reverse Transcription

A concept found in retroviruses, this feature converts an mRNA sequence into a DNA sequence.
